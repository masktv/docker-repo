To set up Jenkins to trigger a job when changes occur in your AWS S3 bucket, you can use AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to create an event-driven architecture. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

1.Set Up an S3 Bucket Notification
    Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    Navigate to the S3 bucket you want to monitor.
    Go to the "Properties" tab of your bucket.
    Scroll down to "Event notifications" and click "Create event notification."
    Configure the event notification:
      Name: Provide a name for the notification.
      Event types: Choose the events you want to monitor (e.g., "All object create events").
      Send to: Choose "SNS topic."
      SNS topic: Either select an existing SNS topic or create a new one.
      Save the changes to your bucket's event notification.

2.Create an SNS Topic
    Navigate to the Amazon SNS service in the AWS Management Console.
    Create a new SNS topic:
      Click "Create topic."
      Select "Standard" for the type of topic.
      Name: Provide a name for your topic.
      Create the topic.
Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the SNS topic. You'll need this later. 

3.Create an AWS Lambda Function
    1. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
    2. Create a new Lambda function:
          Click "Create function."
          Choose "Author from scratch."
          Name: Provide a name for your function.
          Runtime: Choose the runtime you prefer (e.g., Python, Node.js).
          Role: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions or use an existing role with the necessary permissions.

    3. Configure the function code:
         Write the Lambda function code to send a notification or invoke a Jenkins API endpoint when an S3 event is received. Here's a sample Python code snippet to call Jenkins:
........................ Cript is in same file with name lambda script ....................................

    4. Add a trigger:
         Click on "Add trigger."
         Select "SNS" as the trigger type.
         Choose the SNS topic you created earlier.
         Add the trigger.
    5. Deploy the Lambda function.

4.Configure Jenkins to Accept Remote Triggers
    Open Jenkins and go to the job you want to trigger.
    Go to "Configure" for the job.
    In the "Build Triggers" section, check the "Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)" option.
    Provide an authentication token (youâ€™ll need this for your Lambda function).
    Save the configuration.

5.pdate Lambda Function with Jenkins Authentication
    Update the Lambda function code to include the authentication token if your Jenkins instance requires it.

6.Test the Integration
    Upload a file or make a change to your S3 bucket to generate an event.
    Check the Jenkins job to ensure it was triggered successfully.

By following these steps, you'll have a setup where changes in your S3 bucket will trigger an AWS Lambda function, which in turn will invoke your Jenkins job. This solution uses event-driven architecture to create a responsive system that reacts to changes in your AWS environment.
